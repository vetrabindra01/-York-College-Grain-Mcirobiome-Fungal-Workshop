# Grain Mcirobiome (Fungal Workshop)

# Introduction
Mycobiome was profiled in rye, wheat, and rye+wheat that are used as a starting material for sourdough. Grains were grinded separately, mixed in water and filtered. Filtered water was used for the DNA extraction and subjected to mycobiome sequencing using ITS primers.
